[00:41.89]MAN: And here on Radio Rivenden we have Lynne Rawley, 
[00:46.03]the Public Relations Officer of our own Rivenden City Theatre. Hello, Lynne.
[00:50.34]LYNNE: Hello.
[00:52.00]MAN: Now, the theatre is reopening soon after its three-year redevelopment program, isn¡¯t it?
[00:56.73]LYNNE: That¡¯s right, and there are a lot of improvements. 
[00:58.60]The first thing people will see when they go in is that the foyer has been repainted in the original green and gold. 
[01:05.67]Then the box office has been reoriented with its own access form the side of the building instead of through the foyer,
[01:12.16]which means it can be open longer hours, and has more space, too. 
[01:16.68]The shop that used to be in the foyer, which sold books and CDs, 
[01:20.56]is the one part of the redevelopment which isn¡¯t yet complete. 
[01:24.61]The plan is to find new premises for it near the theatre, 
[01:28.20]and we¡¯ve had difficulty finding somewhere suitable. 
[01:30.76]We hope to reopen the shop in the next few months.
[01:34.02]MAN: Will audiences find any difference in the auditorium?
[01:37.40]LYNNE: Yes, we¡¯ve increased the leg-room between the rows. 
[01:40.99]This means that there are now fewer seats but we¡¯re sure audiences will be much happier. 
[01:46.46]And we¡¯ve installed air conditioning, so it won¡¯t get so hot and stuffy. 
[01:50.41]We already had a few seats which were suitable for wheelchair users, 
[01:53.85]and now there are twice as many, which we hope will meet demand. 
[01:57.25]Something else that will benefit audiences is the new lifts. 
[02:01.27]The two we used to have were small and slow. 
[02:04.15]They¡¯ve now gone, and we¡¯ve got much more efficient ones.
[02:07.48]MAN: Anything for the performers?
[02:09.69]LYNNE: Yes, we¡¯ve made a number of improvements backstage. 
[02:12.79]The small dark dressing rooms we used to have have been converted into two large airy rooms, 
[02:18.59]so they¡¯re much more comfortable now. 
[02:20.74]And the state-of-the-art electronic sound and lighting systems have been installed.
[02:29.34]
[02:50.28]2
[02:57.59]MAN: OK, so what¡¯s the first play that audiences can see when the theatre reopens?
[03:03.59]LYNNE: We¡¯ve got a very exciting production of Peter Shaffer¡¯s Royal Hunt of the Sun, 
[03:07.69]which is currently touring the country. 
[03:09.38]That starts on October the 13th and runs till the 19th. 
[03:13.86]We¡¯re experimenting bit with the time the curtain goes up. 
[03:16.44]We used to start all our performances at 7.30, 
[03:19.47]but that made it difficult for people to go home by public transport, 
[03:23.03]so instead we¡¯re beginning at 7. 
[03:25.39]Because at 9.45, when it finished, there are still buses running. 
[03:30.09]Tickets are already selling fast. 
[03:32.20]The Friday and Saturday performances sold out almost immediately and, 
[03:35.96]now there are only tickets for Monday and Thursday.
[03:39.12]MAN: How much are they?
[03:40.30]LYNNE: We¡¯ve introduced a simpler price structure. 
[03:43.03]Ticket prices used to range from ¡ê6 to ¡ê30 but now they¡¯re all ¡ê18. 
[03:49.56]They¡¯re available from the box office, in person, by phone, fax or post, or online
[03:55.38]MAN: OK, Lynne, now if you¡¯d like to give the contact details for the theatre.
